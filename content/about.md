# Hello there

I'm Giacomo Gregoletto, a keyboard-hitter from Italy.

I love complex things like puzzles, guitar solos, snowboard freestyling, and even coding sometimes. You can see some of my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/greguz/). I love to learn new things and keep my brain busy with new challenges.

Show me what you got...
