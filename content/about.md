My name is Giacomo Gregoletto. I have the following qualities:

- I rock multiple Ibanez guitars
- I'm extreamly fast about eating food (life hack)

What else do you need?

### History

When I was a baby programmer, I tried to teach my teddy bear to “code” by pressing random keys. I thought if I spammed `Q` enough, it’d start flying. When it didn’t work, I yelled, **“YOU’RE A BUG!”** and flipped it upside down like a real debugger. 10/10, would not hire that bear. [#CodingLife]() [#FirstBug]()
