### Fifth time’s the charm

Let’s recap the changes this blog has gone through:

1. **November 2018**: Hexo (JavaScript framework)
2. **October 2019**: Metalsmith (minimal JavaScript framework)
3. **January 2022**: Hugo (some kind of DIY theme)
4. **February 2023**: Hugo (more DIY theme tinkering)
5. **September 2025**: Hugo (_No style, please!_)

From this [parkour-like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VhnU3_-KUY) timeline, we can extract a few insights:
Hugo is a good-enough blog framework, and I prefer unstyled websites, especially in the age of enshittification.

I solemnly swear that I'm not going to change this blog again (while talking to myself).
